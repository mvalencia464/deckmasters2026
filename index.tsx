From [helical pilings](/deck-materials-components/deck-footings-framing) driven deep into the clay soils of Rabbit Creek and Glen Alps to rapid 24-hour replacements on Dorbrandt Street in Midtown, our work is visible all over Anchorage because we are the local team that actually lives and works here.",

      highlightBody: "Building a deck in Anchorage means fighting frost heave, earthquake bracing, and snow loads most lower-48 builders have never seen. We frame at 12\" on-center when needed, use helical piers standard, and over-engineer every connection.

          body: [
            "In the Lower 48, building a deck is often a matter of digging a few post holes and pouring concrete. In Anchorage, that is a recipe for disaster. Our unique geology and climate present three distinct challenges that every Deck Masters build is engineered to overcome: **Frost Heave**, **Seismic activity**, and **snow loads**.",
            "**Frost Heave** is the silent killer of Alaskan decks. When the ground freezes, moisture in the soil expands, pushing upward with incredible force. If your pilings aren't deep enough or lack the proper friction coefficient, your deck will heave, twisting the frame and popping fasteners. We utilize industrial-grade [helical piers](/deck-materials-components/deck-footings-framing) that screw deep below the frost line—often 10 to 15 feet down—anchoring your deck to stable strata that never moves, regardless of the temperature.",
            "**Seismic activity** is another non-negotiable factor. Since the 2018 earthquake, code requirements have tightened, but we have always built beyond the minimum. Our hardware packages include tension ties, hurricane clips, and lateral load connectors that ensure your deck remains attached to your home during violent shaking. We don't rely on gravity; we rely on galvanized steel engineering.",
            "Finally, the **snow load** in Anchorage can exceed 50 pounds per square foot, and in areas like Glen Alps, it can be double that. A standard builder might space joists at 16 inches on center. For our composite builds in heavy snow zones, we often tighten that to 12 inches on center. This rigidity prevents the 'trampoline effect' and ensures that even with three feet of wet, heavy snow, your deck structure remains uncompromised."

            "[Alaskan Yellow Cedar and Red Cedar](/deck-materials-components/cedar-decking) are the traditional choices. They offer that undeniable aromatic scent and rustic aesthetic that fits perfectly with a log home or timber-frame structure in Girdwood or Eagle River. However, wood is organic. In our climate, it absorbs moisture, freezes, thaws, and is bombarded by UV radiation during our long summer days. To keep a wood deck looking 'new,' you must commit to annual staining and sealing. Without this, it will turn gray and eventually succumb to rot.",
            "[Composite decking](/deck-materials-components/composite-decking), particularly high-performance lines from [Trex](/deck-materials-components/trex-deck-installation) and TimberTech, has revolutionized Alaskan outdoor living. Modern composites are capped with a polymer shell that is virtually impervious to our weather. They do not rot, warp, crack, or splinter. They never need sanding or staining. For a busy family in South Anchorage or a retiree in Bayshore who wants to spend their summer fishing rather than painting, composite is the superior investment. While the upfront cost is higher, the 25-year cost of ownership is significantly lower when you factor in the price of stain, sealers, and your own labor."

Wind is a major factor; we often design windbreaks using tempered glass or integrated privacy walls that deflect the prevailing gusts from Turnagain Arm.",
            "**Midtown & Spenard:** In tighter urban lots, privacy is the priority. We design vertical louvers, lattice screens, and pergola structures that block the view of neighbors' windows while still allowing light to filter through. These decks often function as outdoor dining rooms, maximizing square footage in smaller backyards.",
            "**Eagle River & Chugiak:** With larger lots and more trees, fire safety becomes a conversation. We specialize in creating 'defensible space' decks using non-combustible framing materials and fire-rated decking options, particularly for homes bordering Chugach State Park.",

            "In a market where 'square footage costs' are skyrocketing, a well-built deck effectively increases the size of your home for 5-6 months of the year. It becomes the dining room, the party venue, and the relaxation zone. When it comes time to sell, a rotting deck is a massive liability that buyers will deduct from their offer. A pristine, low-maintenance [Trex](/deck-materials-components/trex-deck-installation) deck with a warranty transfer is a selling point that can trigger bidding wars.",
            "We build with resale in mind. We design layouts that flow naturally from the kitchen or living room, creating an indoor-outdoor connection that modern buyers crave. Whether you plan to stay for thirty years or sell in three, a Deck Masters deck is an asset on your balance sheet."

Understanding these patterns helps homeowners catch problems early, before a $2,000 repair becomes a $20,000 replacement.",
            "**Ledger Board Separation** is the silent killer. Your ledger board is the critical connection between your deck and your house. In Anchorage, we see ledger failures caused by improper flashing installation, which allows snowmelt to seep behind the board and rot the rim joist of your home. This isn't just a deck problem—it's a structural integrity issue for your entire house. We've responded to emergency calls in **Jewel Lake** and **Bear Valley** where homeowners noticed their deck 'pulling away' from the house by several inches. Our repair protocol involves removing the compromised ledger, treating or replacing the rim joist, installing code-compliant Z-flashing (often Tyvek or Grace Ice & Water Shield), and re-bolting with hot-dipped galvanized lag screws spaced per IRC R507 requirements.",
            "**Joist Rot at Ground Contact** occurs when deck joists are too close to soil or vegetation. We frequently encounter this in older **Spenard** and **Government Hill** homes where the original builder didn't account for Alaska's wet springs. Moisture wicks up into untreated lumber, creating a perfect environment for decay fungi. Our fix involves sistering new pressure-treated joists alongside the damaged ones, raising the deck height if necessary, and installing a vapor barrier beneath the structure.",
            "**Fastener Failure and 'Nail Pops'** are accelerated by our temperature swings. A deck built in July at 70°F will contract significantly when winter hits -10°F. Nails lose their grip, and screws back out. We've seen entire deck surfaces on **Hillside** properties become hazardous 'tripping zones' due to raised fastener heads.

We use **helical piers** that screw deep below the frost line (critical in **Rabbit Creek** and **Glen Alps** where frost heave is severe), hot-dipped galvanized joist hangers rated for Alaska's seismic zone, and code-compliant flashing systems (Tyvek or Grace Ice & Water Shield) that prevent the ledger board rot we see on 60% of older Anchorage decks. When we frame with pressure-treated lumber (2x8, 2x6, 4x12 beams), we're using Ground Contact-rated wood with higher preservative retention than standard PT lumber. This attention to the 'bones' of your deck is why our structures stand straight and true for decades.",

            "This is the most common question we answer during consultations in **Midtown**, **Turnagain**, and **South Anchorage**: 'Should I go with composite or stick with wood?' The answer depends on three factors: your maintenance tolerance, your budget timeline, and your aesthetic priorities.",
            "**Composite Decking (Trex, TimberTech)** is the clear winner for long-term value. Our most popular lines are **Trex Enhance** and **Trex Transcends**, available in Alaska-tested colors like Toasted Sand, Foggy Wharf, and Coastal Bluff. These capped composite boards have a polymer shell that's impervious to moisture, UV radiation, and temperature swings. They will never rot, splinter, or require staining. The upfront cost is approximately 40-60% higher than pressure-treated wood, but the 25-year cost of ownership is significantly lower when you factor in the $500-800 annual cost of staining and sealing a wood deck. **Rebecca K on Shrub Court** is a repeat Trex customer—this summer was her second Trex deck built by Deck Masters. Her two-level installation required zero maintenance beyond an annual hose-down, and she noted, 'I couldn't be happier.'",
            "**Natural Wood (Cedar, Pressure-Treated)** offers undeniable warmth and that classic 'cabin' aesthetic. **Alaskan Yellow Cedar** and **Red Cedar** are naturally rot-resistant and emit a pleasant aroma that composite can't replicate. For homeowners with timber-frame homes or log structures in **Eagle River** or **Peters Creek**, cedar is often the right choice to maintain architectural harmony. However, wood requires commitment. In Anchorage's UV-intense summers, untreated cedar will turn gray within one season. To maintain that rich, honey-brown color, you must clean and seal annually using products like Cabot Australian Timber Oil or Olympic Maximum. **Elise McCarter** chose a beautiful cedar deck with custom built-in benches, and she loves it—but she's also committed to the annual maintenance ritual.",
            "**Pressure-Treated Decking** is the budget option, but we rarely recommend it for deck surfaces in Anchorage. While PT lumber is excellent for framing (where it's hidden), using it for the walking surface means you're committing to annual maintenance without the aesthetic payoff of cedar. PT boards can warp, crack, and develop splinters as they age. For homeowners on a tight budget, we often suggest building the frame with PT lumber and installing a composite surface—giving you the best of both worlds."

Cable railing is perfect for **Hillside** and **Bayshore** properties where preserving the view is paramount. We install these systems with either **Black Aluminum Posts** (powder-coated for corrosion resistance) or **Cedar Posts** (for a warmer, natural look). One critical design choice: we often mount the railing **outside** the deck frame (fascia-mounted) rather than on top. This adds 6-8 inches of usable deck space and creates a cleaner exterior profile.",
            "**Smooth Treated Baluster Railings** are the traditional choice, offering a classic look at a lower price point. We space balusters to meet the 4-inch sphere rule (required by IRC code to prevent small children from slipping through). For composite decks, we often use composite top caps that match the deck surface, creating a cohesive design.",

These galvanized steel shafts have helical blades that screw into the ground like a giant screw, reaching stable soil 8-15 feet below the surface. They're immune to frost heave (the #1 cause of deck failure in **Rabbit Creek** and **Potter Valley**), install in hours rather than days, and can be adjusted if settling occurs. The upfront cost is higher than concrete, but the long-term reliability is unmatched. We used helical piles for **Thomas Keller's project on Sultana Court**, which included a hot tub—the load-bearing requirements were significant, and helical piles provided the necessary engineering capacity.",
            "**Steel Piles** (driven, not helical) are used for extremely challenging sites with bedrock close to the surface or in areas with high water tables. These are less common but critical for certain **Turnagain** and **Spenard** properties where soil conditions are poor.",
            "**Concrete Pier Blocks** are the budget option, but we only use them for low-profile, floating decks where frost heave is less of a concern. For any deck attached to a house or elevated more than 18 inches, we insist on deeper foundations."

Fascia-mounting (attaching posts to the outside edge of the deck frame) adds 6-8 inches of usable deck space and creates a cleaner exterior profile. This technique is particularly valuable on smaller decks in **Midtown** or **Spenard** where every square foot counts. However, fascia-mounting requires engineered blocking inside the rim joist to handle the lateral loads—something we handle as part of our standard installation.",

Installation requires perfect alignment, and the base-mounting hardware must be engineered to handle significant wind loads (glass acts like a sail in Anchorage's wind). Frameless systems typically cost $200-300 per linear foot installed.",

For all our composite builds in snow zones, we often tighten joist spacing to **12 inches on center**, sometimes even 9 inches for particularly heavy load areas.

For typical residential decks with 50 psf snow load, 2x8 joists can span 9-10 feet at 16-inch spacing, 2x10 joists can span 12-13 feet. We often use 2x10 or 2x12 joists to minimize bounce and provide a solid feel.",
            "**Ledger Board Attachment**: The ledger (where the deck attaches to your house) must be bolted with 1/2-inch lag screws or through-bolts spaced per IRC Table R507.9.1.3. Improper ledger attachment is the #1 cause of catastrophic deck failures. We use hot-dipped galvanized hardware and proper flashing (Tyvek or Grace Ice & Water Shield) to prevent rot.",

For composite decks, we source matching colors (Trex Enhance Toasted Sand, Foggy Wharf) to ensure seamless repairs.",
            "**Structural rot** is more insidious. Joists, beams, and ledger boards rot from the inside out, often hidden beneath surface boards. We use moisture meters and probes to detect hidden decay during inspections.

          body: [
            "Wood is hygroscopic—it absorbs and releases moisture with seasonal changes. In Anchorage, spring rains saturate wood fibers, summer sun bakes them dry, and fall rains start the cycle again. This constant expansion and contraction causes cracking, warping, and creates pathways for rot-causing fungi. **Staining and sealing** creates a protective barrier that prevents moisture intrusion while allowing wood to breathe.",
            "**UV degradation** is equally damaging. Alaska's extended summer daylight (19+ hours in June) means your deck receives more UV exposure than decks in the Lower 48. UV radiation breaks down lignin—the natural polymer that gives wood its color and strength. Without protection, cedar turns silver-gray, and pressure-treated lumber fades to a washed-out tan. This isn't just aesthetic—UV-damaged wood is weaker and more susceptible to rot.",
            "**Annual staining** is non-negotiable for wood decks in **Turnagain**, **Rabbit Creek**, and **Chugiak**. We recommend staining in late May or early June, after spring rains have ended but before the intense summer sun arrives. This timing allows the stain to penetrate deeply and cure properly. Homeowners who skip annual staining face deck replacement 10-15 years earlier than those who maintain their decks religiously."

It's a multi-step process that starts with thorough preparation. **Step 1: Cleaning** removes dirt, mildew, algae, and old stain residue. We use biodegradable deck cleaners (not pressure washers, which damage wood fibers) and scrub brushes to lift contaminants. For heavily soiled decks in shaded **Midtown** or **Spenard** yards, we apply mildew removers that kill spores at the root.",
            "**Step 2: Brightening** neutralizes the cleaning chemicals and opens wood pores for maximum stain penetration. We use oxalic acid-based brighteners that restore wood's natural pH and remove tannin stains (those black spots around fasteners). This step is critical—skipping it results in blotchy stain application.",
            "**Step 3: Drying** requires patience. Wood must be completely dry before staining, which in Anchorage's humid climate can take 2-3 days. We use moisture meters to verify wood moisture content is below 15% before proceeding. Staining wet wood traps moisture inside, leading to premature stain failure.",
            "**Step 4: Staining** is done by hand with brush and roller, not sprayers. Brushing forces stain into wood grain, creating better penetration and longer-lasting protection. We apply two coats, allowing 4-6 hours between coats for absorption. For **John Evans**, this meticulous process transformed his weathered deck into a showpiece."

Products like Cabot Australian Timber Oil, Olympic Maximum, and Sikkens Cetol soak into wood fibers rather than sitting on the surface. This creates a flexible, breathable barrier that moves with the wood as it expands and contracts. Oil-based stains also enhance wood grain, creating that rich, natural look homeowners love.",
            "**Semi-transparent stains** are our most popular option. They provide UV protection and water repellency while allowing wood grain to show through. Available in colors from natural cedar tones to darker walnut shades, semi-transparent stains work beautifully on new cedar decks in **Eagle River** and **Peters Creek**.",
            "**Solid stains** (essentially thin paint) provide maximum UV protection and color consistency but hide wood grain entirely. We recommend solid stains for older decks with significant weathering or discoloration where homeowners want a uniform appearance. Solid stains last 3-4 years in Anchorage versus 1-2 years for semi-transparent.",
            "**Water-based stains** are eco-friendly and low-odor but don't penetrate as deeply as oil-based products. They're appropriate for composite decks or in situations where oil-based products can't be used (near salmon streams or environmentally sensitive areas). We've used water-based stains in **Potter Valley** and coastal areas where runoff is a concern."

We strip all remaining stain (using chemical strippers or sanding), repair damaged boards, brighten the wood, and apply two coats of fresh stain. Restoration projects take 3-5 days and cost $1,500-$2,500. We completed a restoration for **Boomer Ross** who was preparing to sell his home—the transformation added significant value to his listing.",
            "**First-time staining** (new deck construction) requires special preparation. New pressure-treated lumber must weather for 3-6 months before staining to allow preservatives to leach out.

This seems expensive until you consider the alternative: a neglected deck requires replacement after 10-12 years ($15,000-$25,000), while a maintained deck lasts 25-30 years.

We've responded to calls in **Glen Alps** and **Hillside** where frost heave lifted entire deck sections 3-4 inches. The only solution is demolition and rebuilding with proper frost-proof foundations (helical piles or deep footings).",
            "**Extensive structural rot** makes replacement necessary. If more than 40% of joists, beams, or ledger boards show rot, the cost to replace all structural members approaches new construction costs. At that point, you're essentially building a new deck anyway—might as well start fresh with modern materials and updated design.",

Rather than trying to expand an aging structure, we replaced it with a much larger Trex deck that provided the space he wanted. Replacement allowed us to engineer proper support for the expanded footprint.",

Homeowners in **Eagle River** and **Chugiak** with 15-20 year old pressure-treated decks want the zero-maintenance benefits of composite.

Our inspection costs $300-$500 but can save you $10,000+ by identifying problems before you close. We've discovered decks that needed complete replacement on homes where the general inspector said 'deck appears serviceable.'",
            "**Before selling a home**: Sellers benefit from pre-listing inspections that identify problems before buyers discover them. Addressing issues proactively prevents deal-killing surprises during buyer inspections. **Boomer Ross** likely had an inspection before listing his home, which led to the restoration work that helped his home sell quickly.",
            "**After severe weather**: Anchorage's winter storms, heavy snow loads, and spring flooding can damage decks. We offer post-storm inspections to verify structural integrity. After the November 2018 earthquake, we inspected hundreds of decks for seismic damage (cracked footings, shifted beams, pulled ledger bolts).",

We use moisture meters to detect hidden rot, probe suspected areas with awls, and replace any compromised framing members. We also check joist spacing—if it's 24 inches on center (common for old wood decks), we add blocking to bring it to 16 inches for composite decking, which provides a more solid feel.",

            "**Moisture protection** is the primary benefit. Wood absorbs water like a sponge, and in Anchorage's climate (spring rains, summer humidity, fall rains), unprotected wood stays wet for months. Wet wood is perfect for rot-causing fungi. Sealing creates a hydrophobic barrier that causes water to bead and run off instead of soaking in. This simple protection prevents 80% of deck rot.",
            "**Freeze-thaw damage prevention**: When water-saturated wood freezes, it expands. When it thaws, it contracts. This cycle repeats 50-100 times per winter in Anchorage, creating cracks, splits, and structural damage. Sealed wood doesn't absorb enough moisture to experience significant freeze-thaw damage. We've seen unsealed decks in **Glen Alps** and **Hillside** with 1/4-inch cracks after just three winters. Sealed decks in the same neighborhoods show minimal cracking after 15 years.",
            "**UV protection**: Alaska's extended summer daylight (19+ hours in June) means intense UV exposure. UV radiation breaks down lignin—the natural polymer that gives wood its color and strength. Unsealed cedar turns silver-gray within one season. Unsealed pressure-treated lumber fades to washed-out tan. Quality sealers contain UV inhibitors that block 90%+ of damaging radiation, keeping wood looking fresh for years.",
            "**Mildew and algae prevention**: Shaded decks in **Midtown**, **Spenard**, and **Turnagain** grow black mildew and green algae on unsealed wood. These organisms aren't just ugly—they hold moisture against the wood surface, accelerating rot. Sealers with mildewcides prevent growth, keeping your deck clean and dry."

Products like Cabot Australian Timber Oil, Olympic Maximum, and Sikkens Cetol soak 1/8 to 1/4 inch into wood fibers, creating deep protection that moves with the wood as it expands and contracts. Oil-based sealers enhance wood grain and provide rich, natural color. They last 2-3 years in Anchorage's climate before needing reapplication.",
            "**Film-forming sealers** (essentially thin varnish) sit on the wood surface rather than penetrating. They provide excellent water protection but can peel and crack as wood moves. We use film-forming sealers only on horizontal surfaces (railings, benches) where peeling is less problematic. They're not appropriate for deck surfaces where foot traffic would accelerate wear.",
            "**Water-based sealers** are eco-friendly and low-odor but don't penetrate as deeply as oil-based products. They're appropriate for composite decks or in environmentally sensitive areas (near salmon streams, wetlands). We've used water-based sealers in **Potter Valley** and coastal areas where runoff is a concern. They last 1-2 years versus 2-3 years for oil-based.",
            "**Clear vs. tinted sealers**: Clear sealers provide UV protection and water repellency while showing natural wood color. Tinted sealers (semi-transparent stains) add color while still allowing wood grain to show through. We recommend tinted sealers for decks that have weathered gray—the tint restores rich color while the sealer provides protection. **Erik Gonsalves** likely received a tinted sealer that transformed his weathered deck."

For heavily soiled decks, we apply mildew removers that kill spores at the root. Cleaning takes 2-4 hours for a typical 300-square-foot deck.",
            "**Step 2: Brightening** neutralizes cleaning chemicals and opens wood pores for maximum sealer penetration. We use oxalic acid-based brighteners that restore wood's natural pH and remove tannin stains (black spots around fasteners). This step is critical—skipping it results in blotchy sealer application and poor penetration.",
            "**Step 3: Drying** requires patience. Wood must be completely dry before sealing—moisture content below 15% as verified with moisture meters. In Anchorage's humid climate, this takes 2-3 days after cleaning. Sealing wet wood traps moisture inside, leading to premature sealer failure and accelerated rot.",
            "**Step 4: Sealing** is done by hand with brush and roller, not sprayers. Brushing forces sealer into wood grain, creating better penetration and longer-lasting protection. We apply two coats, allowing 4-6 hours between coats for absorption. The first coat soaks in deeply; the second coat builds surface protection. For **Erik Gonsalves**, this meticulous process delivered the high-quality results he praised.",

New cedar can be sealed immediately but benefits from a month of weathering to open grain pores. We schedule first-time sealing in late summer for spring-built decks.",
            "**Existing decks**: Reseal every 2-3 years for oil-based sealers, 1-2 years for water-based. The 'water test' tells you when it's time: sprinkle water on the deck surface. If it beads up, the sealer is still working. If it soaks in, it's time to reseal. Most decks in **South Anchorage**, **Rabbit Creek**, and **Chugiak** need resealing every 2 years.",
            "**High-traffic areas**: Stairs, around doors, and near grills wear faster than the main deck surface. We often reseal these areas annually while the main deck goes 2-3 years. This targeted approach saves money while maintaining protection where it's needed most.",

            "Professional sealing costs $2.00-$3.50 per square foot including all prep work, materials, and labor. A 300-square-foot deck runs $600-$1,050 every 2-3 years. This seems expensive until you consider the alternative: an unsealed deck requires replacement after 10-12 years ($15,000-$25,000), while a sealed deck lasts 25-30 years. The sealing investment ($600 every 2 years = $6,000 over 20 years) saves $10,000+ in avoided replacement costs.",
            "**DIY vs. Professional**: Homeowners can seal their own decks and save money. However, DIY sealing often fails within 1-2 years due to inadequate prep work, wrong product selection, or poor application technique. Our professional sealing lasts 2-3 years because we do the prep work correctly and use commercial-grade products unavailable at big-box stores.",
            "For homeowners in **Hillside**, **Bayshore**, and **Goldenview** with premium cedar decks, professional sealing is worth the investment. Your deck is a major aesthetic feature of your home—it deserves professional care. **Erik Gonsalves** recognized this value and strongly recommends our high-quality approach."

            "For elevated decks, an under-deck drainage system is a game-changer. We install systems like **Trex RainEscape** or **TimberTech DrySpace** that capture water *before* it falls through the deck boards. These systems consist of troughs and downspouts installed between the joists, channeling water into a gutter system at the beam.",
            "This transforms the damp, dark area under your deck into a bright, dry outdoor living room. You can install soffit lighting, ceiling fans, and even outdoor TVs without fear of water damage. It effectively doubles your usable outdoor square footage, providing a sheltered haven during our rainy Augusts."

          body: [
            "In Anchorage, building a deck isn't just about aesthetics; it's about engineering for survival against extreme forces. Our unique climate and geology demand a level of structural integrity far beyond what's found in the Lower 48. We meticulously engineer every Deck Masters project to withstand three primary challenges: **Frost Heave**, **Seismic Activity**, and **Extreme Snow Loads**.",
            "**Frost Heave:** This is the silent destroyer of Alaskan foundations. As ground moisture freezes, it expands with immense force, pushing upward. Standard concrete footings are often 'grabbed' by this expanding soil and lifted, leading to uneven decks, structural strain, and popping fasteners. Our solution involves industrial-grade [helical piers](/deck-materials-components/deck-footings-framing). These galvanized steel shafts are screwed deep below the frost line—typically 10 to 15 feet in Anchorage—anchoring your deck to stable, undisturbed strata. This 'Frost-Proof Stability' ensures your deck remains perfectly level, year after year.",
            "**Seismic Activity:** Since the 2018 earthquake, Anchorage's building codes have become even more stringent, but we've always built beyond minimum requirements. Located in Seismic Design Category D, our decks require advanced bracing. We integrate **Simpson Strong-Tie** tension ties, hurricane clips, and lateral load connectors that securely fasten your deck to your home. We ensure a 'continuous load path' from the deck surface to the foundation, designed to distribute and dissipate seismic forces, keeping your family safe during ground shaking events.",

            "In neighborhoods like **Prominence Pointe** where lots are often steep or terraced, we use laser levels to establish positive drainage before we even set a footing. If the natural grade is insufficient, we regrade the site, bringing in D1 gravel to create a stable, shedding surface that prevents water from pooling around your posts."

            "We install French drains—trenches filled with gravel and perforated pipe—around the perimeter of the deck or patio. These drains intercept subsurface water and divert it to a safe discharge point or dry well. This keeps the soil around your footings dry and stable, significantly reducing the risk of frost heave."

            "These surfaces allow water to percolate directly into the ground, reducing the burden on your yard's drainage system. We use a base of clear chip rock that acts as a reservoir, holding water until it can naturally infiltrate the subsoil.
